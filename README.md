# CeListial

## Overview

CeListial is a task management application that enables users to create and assign projects to team members. The app is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and utilizes the Django REST framework to handle data transfer. In addition to creating and assigning tasks, Tasker also allows users to easily update or delete tasks and projects. When a project is deleted, the app uses the "CASCADE" feature to ensure that all associated tasks are also deleted, providing a streamlined and efficient workflow.

Django ORM manages the database models and queries, enabling seamless data retrieval and storage. The front-end is designed using HTML and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for managing projects and tasks.
